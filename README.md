_slated
=======
**_slated** is a community effort to get [`_s` (or `underscores`)](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) translated.

Getting Started
---------------
If your theme is based on _s, and your language is supported, pick the .po file from the [/languages](https://github.com/ptbello/_slated/tree/master/languages) folder of this repo, generate your .mo file and drop both in the /languages folder of your theme.
